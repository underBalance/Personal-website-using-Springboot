# Personal-website-using-Springboot

This repository contains the source code for my personal website. It also serves as a playground to experiment with Spring Boot, REST APIs, and general web development concepts.

In the first sprint, I focused on building the initial version of the website, including personal information, ideas for future projects, and links to projects I have already developed. This phase allowed me to reinforce my understanding of Spring Boot fundamentals.

Since I had previous experience with Maven, Tomcat, and related technologies from college, the learning curve was smooth, allowing me to focus more on design decisions and overall architecture rather than tooling.

Throughout the development process, I have used AI-assisted tools (such as Codex) to validate best practices and keep the architecture clean and maintainable. Writing clear, well-structured code is something I care deeply about, as it is essential for becoming a solid and reliable software engineer.

The next sprint that I will push is a web scraping feature that let's you see the price in the market for luxury watches as Rolex or Omega, but it still needs some features and some architecture design for things such as if I store data on a DB or not. Anyways it should be ready in about a week from today.
